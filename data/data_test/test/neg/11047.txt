I ordered from Taco_King via Food_Panda . The_Quesadillas were burnt and I had to pick off the burnt charcoal parts to try to eat it . Then , I tried the fried burrito , which was very greasy and unhealthy . I had a surprise in the burrito - a gross piece of hair .
I wanted to give Taco_King a try as I love Mexican food , but will never order from here again . I highly recommend other Mexican_Restaurants .
FoodPanda asked to take pictures of the food . I regret eating most of it ( I was hungry after waiting an hour for delivery ) , but now feel sick to my stomach .
