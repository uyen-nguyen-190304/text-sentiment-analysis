The fish part is just like any normal waffle , which is fine . However the cream part was actually sour yogurt , tasting VERY weird . And you ' d THINK there ' s chocolate but it was just watermelon cubes coated in chocolate fondue ( which was not even close to good ) . Overall the whole thing tastes just plain weird in a bad way . On top of that it ' s pricey for such an ice cream . I ' m positive that I ' m never coming back to this .
