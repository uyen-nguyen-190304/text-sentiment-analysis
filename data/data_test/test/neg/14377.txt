Our team went to this restaurant today . We ordered foods 1 hour in advanced . But when we come , we had to wait for nearly 1hour more . Nothing special with their foods . When we asked their waiters / waitresses , they showed no response . Last but not least , the price was surprising us . Unbelivable ! Never come back again !
