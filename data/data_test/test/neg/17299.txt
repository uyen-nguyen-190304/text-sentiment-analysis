After 10 years as a regular customer i have received the wooooorst sub ever here in Vietnam . I have been eaten subway in many destinations and always loved it . Always fresh and good . This time i gave it a try in Vietnam and first time i had to say i didnt want to eat it anymore . When i came in the shop
the first thing was ... okaaay ... no one is here . I studied the menu and ordered the pizza cheese special sauce sub or something like that . Chose 1 foot long cheese oregano sub , toasted with cheese please . Well i had a phone call so didnt watch her doing that step . She toasted it and then asked me for vegetables . I said everything except of olives ... she started to put it on and wow ... the salad was muddy and yellow ... the tomatoes not fresh and the shallots were normal onions and and and ... she asked me for the sauce ... i said western ... she didnt understand so i had to say the name southwest and she started to drip a little bit like 1 spoon on the whole foot long sub ... i asked for more of course but she still just add a few drops ... stingy girl ... . i added salt pepper for some more taste ... well she wrapped my sub up and then i thought ... what the ... my sub looks only half as big as normally ... well chose a table to sit and eat ... unwrapped it . . touched it and again ... whaaaat theee ... . my sub was totally cold ... moist and not toasted at all ... why the hell did she put it in the oven when it is not turned on ? ? ? ? i searched for the cheese from this pizza sub if it is melted and saw she didnt add any cheese ... and the special sauce was nowhere to find too ... again stingy giiirl ... . and regarding vegetables ... althought i said all kind of vegetables she didnt add sweet pepper or only very few from everthing ... the subway standard is at least or exactly 6 pieces of each but she was below standard ... my so called cheese oregano bread was a plane bread with no cheese ... and no oregano ... . i asked them to toasted it again because i couldnt eat it at all but they didnt want . just said well your salad wont be fresh anymore ... i just thought ... well your vegetables was not fresh at all from the beginning already ... . damn ... truely my worst sub ever ... .
