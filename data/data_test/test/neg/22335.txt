After seeing online reviews about a cheap sushi joint on Nguyen_Thai_Hoc street , me and a few co - workers decided to check out the place after work . Once we got there , there ' s nobody outside to look over our bikes . Apparently the security staff had gone off to somewhere . We parked and went inside anyway . As far as pricing go , this place IS_NOT cheap . It ' s about the same as Tokyo_Deli if not slightly more expensive .
The food itself took about 15 minutes to arrive and the atmosphere was quite bad . It ' s more like a place for you to get drunk while yelling at each others rather than a quiet eatery where you could enjoy a decent meal with your friends .
