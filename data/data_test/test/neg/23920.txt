After long walk around Quy_Nhon street , i was referred to this joint by a local . It is supposed to be well known for com ga , one of my favorite dish . The difference with this place ' s dish is they fried the chicken instead of boiled it . I ' m used to dipping the boiled chicken with nuoc mam gung or sweet gingered fish sauce . Anyway , the dish is ok . The chicken is a bit too dried . It wasn ' t spiced up at all . They pretty much fried the chicken leg without adding anything to it . I ' d rather get popeye chicken and eat it with their rice , which would have tasted much better . As a result , their chicken tasted rubbery . Felt like i was chewing on a piece of rubber band . I paid 80k for the dish and a can of Coke . A bit pricey for being located in boon town Quy_Nhon . I don ' t think this place is binh dan at all . Overall , i would ' t come back . There ' s probably many other places out there that should be better . I ' d give 2.5 stars out of 5 for this joint .
