It ' s been the best healthy place that I have tried so far . To call it the " best " I ' m considering a couple of parameters , like the quality of food , efficiency , and diversity of ingredients .
The good news is that you can pick vegetables and fresh ingredients that you like the most . Then , you select if you want to have rice or quinoa as your base , if you want to add some proteins .
I ' ve talk to a couple of friends that were not very happy with their experience at beefsteak , and here is my answer why : the selection of ingredients shouldn ' t be totally random . If it ' s your first time , try to get one of their popular bowls like the Eden and then try to make small modifications in the original ingredients . As you go , you figure it out what is the right combination for you !
