I have been to this restaurant on Christmas . The staffs arr helpful and friendly . Foods are good , and the restaurant has space for family gatherthing . The best thing I love about this restaurant is that we dont have BBQ smell over our clothes as it has a very good BBQ equipment . Highly recommended !
