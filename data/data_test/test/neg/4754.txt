I ' ve never been to a sushi restaurant this bad in my life .
1 . The fish was not as flavorful as I expected . The taste has gone blend as if the fish has been sititng there for a long time .
2 . I ordered the sashimi platter ( 6-8 persons one ) . The seaweed was slimmy . Maybe it wasn ' t washed carefully ? I assumed because I ' ve never seen such slimmy seaweed on a sashimi platter before .
3 . The edamame was tossed in a bunch of salt . It was salty . I told the waitress and guess what she said to me . She said " I didn ' t prepare this . The kitchen staffs did " . I got no apology , no explanation , no understanding from her . Of course I know she didn ' t prepare that but at least she had to say something to make the customer feel better and that the restaurant will fix it next time or something . That was lack of experience and training .
4 . Sorry to be mean but one of the guy waitors had a very bad smell so whenever he reached over to put down my dish , man it was like dejavu . The nightmare happens all over again .
5 . The greentea jelly : I think the person who made it put a little too much gelatin because it was a bit hard for me to sink my spoon through it .
6 . The salmon and tuna house mix carpaccio or something , it was ok but if the sauce was a litlte sour , it would be better . That ' s just my suggestions . I don ' t know what other customers prefer .
