First off , if you ' ve not been to this area , you should . It ' s a unique area of Saigon , completely different from anywhere else in the city .
We had pizza and a smoothie while here . The pizza was great - thin base , real mozarella and cooked in a proper pizza oven . Smoothie was also very good , fresh and the staff were attentive enough to ask if it needed to be a bit sweeter ( which it didn ' t ) .
The price , especially given that it ' s not too far from Phu_My_Hung , is outstanding . 90,000 d for a good quality pizza that will easily satisfy one person .
I ' d highly recommend visiting this area if you ' re looking to explore a bit and see something new , and definitely stop by here for some good food if you ' re hungry .
