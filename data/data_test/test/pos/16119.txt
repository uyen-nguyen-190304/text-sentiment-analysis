❤ ️ I came to WaBar on my birthday and the service is amazing here ! : )
The staff had good recommendations .
It had outside seatings so it was fairly comfortable .
The view of the pond is absolutely amazing too !
Both the food and the drinks are good .
The price is more affordable compairing to most places in district 7 .
