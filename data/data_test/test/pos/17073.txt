I have seen this sushi restaurant for a long time and now I got a chance to try it . Check it on Foody and got good ratings from Foody ' s members .
The place is so beautiful , authentic Japanese style restaurant in District 1 . Love decorations and atmosphere , quite nice services from staffs as well .
Menus are full of sushi , sashimi and other Japanese foods ... We tried several sushi and a Gyu_Niku_Ramen .
We love all sushi we have tried , so fresh ane delicious , prices are not expensive with this kind of quality and decorations !
Restaurant also bonus for us red bean sweets after billings .
We will come back here for more !
