It ' s the first time I visit Phu_Quoc and Vinpearl_Resort . I really love Vinpearl_Resort in Phu_Quoc . Beautiful places with huge areas . Large pool in between two buildings for customers to swim or they can choose sea swimming which is very near there .  
They clean rooms twice a day , in the morning and in the evening which is quite surprise .
In_Vinpearl_Resort , you also can visit Vinpearl_Safari with extra fees ( 350k/person ) , but I don ' t think it ' s a good idea to visit , not much animals in there and quite simple .
Prices are high , which is understandable for 5-star resort . Espresso for 80k VND ( plus extra 5% service fees and 10% tax ) , 100k/espresso ! ! ! It ' s really high !  
For a night in resort , it ' s gonna cost you 9m VND/night !
