Nicely decorate coffee shop with extensive range of coffee and drinks . Nice decor and comfortable seating , great music and nice ambience . Ice sorbet drinks were great , cheap and nice ! Ice coffee well made and not too heavy ! Matcha latte is quite good as well ! All in all , cheap but seriously good ! Highly recommended !
