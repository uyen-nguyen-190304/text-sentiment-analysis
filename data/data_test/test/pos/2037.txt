My boyfriend and i were looking for some delicious seafood . Crab_House had good reviews so we thought we would check it out . We ordered the Comb # 4 and it blew us away . Every part of it was delicious . The shrimp , the squid , the corn , and the sausages were all great . The crabs were the best part though . They were so meat , so juicy , and so sweet . The staff is also exceptionally friend , head and shoulders above most vietnamese restaurants . We have two more nights in Phu_Quoc and I ' m sure we will be eating here again .
