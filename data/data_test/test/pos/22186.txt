- 1ST BEST : YOGURT
At_Frugos , I can find my favorite flavor . . And it has a lot of " weird " flavor but that " weird " is good and make customers want to come back and enjoy .
- 2ND BEST : TOPPINGS
You can ' t find any special and many toppings at other yogurt store except Frugos . I love cheesecake , toffin and gummy bear . . when i come to topping place , i can ' t resist of looking at them and pick them into my cup .
3RD BEST : EMPLOYEES
With a big friendly family at Frugos , you can see the warmness , kindness of Frugos employees that serve customers . They always give you a perfect smile and a really good serving . I really love their employees
- 4TH BEST : PRICE
With a fixed price , 29k/100gr for a healthy cup of yogurt is worthy . . I definitely can pay every pennies of mine to eat yogurt at Frugos everyday ( in the future ) lol : ) ) . . Anw , the price is good , it ' s suitable for everyone to enjoy . .
