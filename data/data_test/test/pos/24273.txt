Really great new Restaurant in Tay_Ho . Family run with a true intent to make you feel at home being taken care of by the family . Diverse menu that seems inexpensive for what you get . A_Value for sure . All this and the top two floors delivering the besdt most comprehensive rooftop views of West_Lake are not even officially open yet .
