I celebrated my birthday here . The menu is very diversified with a reasonable prices . They offer you a nice complimentary juices jug . The staff is noce but sometimes you have to wait a little bit as the place is very crowded .
Free parking .
The food is seasoned nicely , but the hot pot is too sweet .
