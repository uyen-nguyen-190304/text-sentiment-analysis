We were having a family holiday and after several days of Vietnamese meals I voted for a more Western dinner ( I am a Westerner but my family is Viet ) and this restaurant was a very short walk from our hotel . I was impressed from the very beginning although we did have a couple of little hiccups during the meal . It seemed that evening there was a big event upstairs which meant the kitchen was running a little slower than usual and unfortunately the mains started to come out before the entrees ... . Anyway , my French_Onion_Soup was a pleasant surprise and absolutely delicious . It came with a puff pastry ' cap ' over the soup bowl . There were 8 of us and we all had various meals all of which were ' thumbs up ' . I had a steak which was delicious . Couldn ' t fault the attentive and well mannered service .
We went back a second time towards the end of our stay and enjoyed an even better evening . We were greeted warmly by one of the waiters who recognised us from our previous visit . I had a pan fried Bass which I think would have to be one of the best fish meals I have ever had . We also sampled several of the small but very tasty desserts between us . Everyone else was happy with their choices too ( I can ' t remember them , sorry but very little food was left ) .
Admittedly we only went here for a change from typical Vietnamese meals so I only have a one sided review but from what we experienced I would like to think you would not be dissapointed with their Viet cuisine .
